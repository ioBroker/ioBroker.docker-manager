It is a lightweight, isolated environment that runs the application defined by the Docker image.\nWhen you run a Docker image, it creates a container that encapsulates the application and its dependencies, allowing it to run consistently across different environments.\nIn ioBroker notation, it is like an instance of an adapter.",
